        <font face="Verdana" size="5"><b>Recap</b></font></p>
       <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">If you've gotten this far, then by now you should understand the simplicity of YQL, and also it's ability to 
	   dispense information for developers. We went through 2 different queries, one for creating a craigslist search application, and one for creating
	   a stock market information application. Let's go over the steps one more time to really put the nail in the coffin.
	   </font></p>
		
		<font face="Verdana" size="5"><b>Step 1: Find your table</b></font></p>
       <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">The first step in both examples was to find the right table to query for.  If you are using a craiglist search, then 
	   find the craigslist search table. If you are making a weather application, go down to yahoo's weather table instead.
	   </font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="5"><b>Step 2: Learn the table query conditions</b></font></p>
       <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"> You know by now that tables in YQL are slightly different when it comes to their conditions to query.  Thus, many times
	   the query statement will differ between tables.  You can easily learn your table's query instructions by clicking on the table's name located at the circled
	   location of the screen. The Image below demonstrates where. Once the tab is opened, you can see the different requirements in a form  allowing you to learn
	   how to query for that table. 
	   </font></p>

		<br>
		<font face="Verdana" size="5"><b>Step 3: Response type and Tree form View</b></font></p>
       <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">After you understand how to query your table, Pick your response type (JSON/XML) and use the tree form view
	   to easily understand how the response should be parsed.
	   </font></p>
		<img src="weather3.png" width="1200">
		<br>
		<font face="Verdana" size="5"><b>Step 4: REST QUERY link</b></font></p>
       <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Lastly, once you are satisfied with the information you are getting from your response, partition the 
	   REST QUERY link on the bottom to use in your application for the response.
	   <p>And that's it! If you followed the guide, you should now be able to create YQL queries and retrieve a plethora of information to use for your 
	   web application.  The possibilities are endless with over 1000 different tables that you have access to with Yahoo.  I'd like to thank you for reading
	   my guide, and I hope that it helped to orient yourself to YQL and understand how you can use YQL for your next web application.
